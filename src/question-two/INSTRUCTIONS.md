## Question 2

For this question we want you to fetch data from a couple of endpoints on the server.  This data will describe the events of some people’s day (specifically 01/09/2018).  We’d like you to take that data, merge it together and display it in some form of timeline.

We don’t need any input fields, toggle states or transitions on the page.  You can start fetching as soon as the page has loaded and display once the data has been received.

On the server you’ll find an endpoint called ‘/resources’ which has data on a couple of people.  These people were assigned a few Jobs and Activities (‘/jobs’ and ‘/activities’ endpoints respectively) during the day.  Each person's assignment for the day can be found via the ‘/jobAllocations’ and ‘/activityAllocations’ endpoints.  You should note that each job and activity may be assigned to multiple people.

Once you have that data we’d like you to display it in the Swimlane component provided.  Please do not change the shape of the properties being sent to the Swimlane component, you will need to modify the data received from the server to fit the component's structure.

Note: While it would be better to have the server expose an endpoint that provides all this data in a nice format, we want to see what you do when given data from a couple of different sources.

Note: We have provided a `service` prop to the component that is defined in /src/service/DataService.js.  It has access to a graphql client and a http request library.  If you wish to fetch data from the server we suggest you do it from there.

### What we're looking for

The goal of Question 2 is to see how our candidates reason the merging of multiple endpoints and produce a clean code solution. Our primary view will be on code readability and any performance compromises made. Including some testing would be beneficial as well as it would create an opportunity to iterate through the solution while trying to find a solution that is clear.
