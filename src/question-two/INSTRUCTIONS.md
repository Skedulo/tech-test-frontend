## Question 2

For this question we want you to fetch data from a couple of endpoints on the server.  This data will describe the events of some people’s day (specifically 01/09/2018).  We’d like you to take that data, merge it together and render it as a JSON blob in the component.

There is a unit test that contains the expected output from the component. It should pass once the JSON blob is rendered in the expected shape.
### What we're looking for

While our primary focus will be determining if candidates can get the test to pass, we would also like to see how they reason the merging of multiple endpoints and produce a clean solution. Including some extra tests would be beneficial as it would create an opportunity to iterate through the solution while trying to find a solution that is clear.
