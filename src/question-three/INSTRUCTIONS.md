## Question 3

For this question, you will need to retrieve jobs, their number of allocations and display the information in a page layout you will build.

This is what the layout should look like:

[Page Layout](https://www.figma.com/file/K1Z6ZQp2nmFamEsjMEQ6LoBW/Question-three?node-id=1%3A34)

Some must have functionality includes:

* The layout should always be the full width and height of the viewport, the whole page should never scroll.
* Both main columns should scroll independently and only vertically when filled with content.
* The content for the header could be dynamic. In the layout it only has heading text, but it could have supplementary text, tabs or some other dynamically sized content.
* The content for the right most column does not need to be dynamic nor correlate to anything within the data, it only needs to be populated with copies of the boxes shown in the mockups.  We also need to see that section populated with enough content that it would need to be scrolled when displayed on a normal sized monitor.
