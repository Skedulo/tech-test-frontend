## Question 3 Response

Compromises:
* Spinner hasn't been implemented when loading the data
* I think the main compromise here was just continuing to use CSS, and not being able to leverage variables.
* Also, on the "toggleTabs" button, I'm just showing a read-only version of the AvailableTabs component from the app,
exported from App.tsx rather than putting it in a common directory which is awkward.
