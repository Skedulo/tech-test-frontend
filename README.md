## Overview

Hi! Welcome to the Skedulo frontend tech project. You will see we have 3 questions and each of their instructions are located in the local INSTRUCTIONS.md. Please complete these exercises then save to a private github repository. Once you're ready reach out to your hiring manager and they will share some github names to add as collaborators who will review your submission.

Once you have completed all exercises it would be great to see a readme that contains some of your thinking while working through the test, constraints you worked within, some decisions and compromises you needed to make, and anything else you think would be interesting for the reviewers to know.

* [Question 1](./src/question-one/INSTRUCTIONS.md) - React input example
* [Question 2](./src/question-two/INSTRUCTIONS.md) - Data manipulation from multiple sources
* [Question 3](./src/question-three/INSTRUCTIONS.md) - Responsive CSS design

Good luck! And if you have any questions, don't hesitate to contact your hiring manager.
